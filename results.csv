connectbot,connectbot,https://github.com/connectbot/connectbot/issues/472,472,"Thank you for acknowledging my issues.I think new host editor screen shows up when pressing Add button on the hosts screen, or when long pressing a host in the list and choosing edit in its popup menu. As far as I think this screen is fully accessible.I don't know if Connectbot can remember ssh password, I would expect a corresponding password entry in this dialog. At the other hand I understand it does not perhaps remember passwords entered via keyboard because of the possible security concerns.As for the consistency you appear to have changed all switches on this screen to so called checkable menu item views however when enabling ""Use ssh agent"" option, there is a checkbox saying ""require confirmation"". This is plain checkbox. It's still accessible though.When not considering accessibility at all terminal is a control where we can see output from a console. It does not provide ability to navigate over the text using the keyboard because almost all the input is passed throught to the application running inside a terminal. It is possible to scroll the terminal by using the mouse and there might be a terminal implementation specific mode allowing caret navigation over the text (screen comes to my mind while writting this).Thus on other platforms (e.g. command prompt on Windows, Gnome terminal on linux desktop, or even pure virtual console on unix / linux like systems) ability to review the content of a terminal is left to the screen readers. Screen readers on all these platforms including android alter the interaction paradigm a bit (on android it's through so called explore by touch mode where touching does not activate views under the finger but double tap is needed).So according to this we should override as little when it comes to the interaction and navigation as possible. Of course that may lead to some compromises but that is really the way to go I think because ideally this should just work and people should discover working platform native accessibility support from the start since they have launched the app.Trying to further explain on this consider just any view on android be it a label next to an interactive view such as text entry, checkbox or just a simple text view displaying text inside a dialog. Such a control also does not provide its specific navigation commands. People who don't need screen readers / assistive technologies will just look at it and those relying on the accessibility support will receive platform / disability specific support. So our terminal view should work as close as possible to this. This is perhaps partially opposite you might have gathered from Casey Burkhartd a few years ago while meging his original accessibility related patches but I think this might be because accessibility was not there on Android since its day one and at that time I think it had still been evolving.Unfortunatelly there is one big challenge on Android. When using screen readers on other platforms with interactive apps running inside a terminal that manipulate the caret such as text editors, file manager and similar, screen readers on the platforms where there is not enough API for such interaction are monitoring caret position and try to report new context as it changes. On the platforms where there are APIS for this the terminal view sends an event describing caret movement and screen readers can then just report the event. I think there is such an API on Android however I imagine it might be tricky to implement so I would make this second most priority after basic text changes and text review is working.Now to your questions:* Frankly Most blind people have natural issues handling colours, color changes and similar. I wo-ld say for typical console based apps such as built-in shell, core utils and similar apps it's not important at all. I know people tend to format their ls output with coours for example but I am never doing that and I think other blind people might have similar habits. In interactive apps such as ncurses based ones, colours might indicate a particular control an author would like to resemble. So if we might be able to get that far then on Windows and on Linux (GTK and QT) there are accessibility API's where authors can describe text formatting. Hopefully there is something similar on Android. The only apps I have recognized providing such text formatting details to screen readers are Google docs and spreadsheets. I am not sure this is documented. I suggest to put this aside until all more serious accessibility issues are ,addressed.* Screen clear perhaps means that terminal content is cleared in order to be replaced with new content as it arrives. I imagine looking at a ls command output and then deciding to open one of the files in nano for example. listing is cleared and new content is displayed as the new application generates content. I expect this to also happen with so called accessibility buffer.* There is no magic related to box draving characters. These might just be any characters such as a bunch of dashes, bunch of letter I and similar. Terminal emulators on other platforms don't filter out these.* When touch exploration is in effect there are various approaches and I am not sure we are going to override the default behaviour reporting all the text of a view. When explore by touch is activated on android handling touch events works differently than while explore by touch is off. If there will be enough energy and knowledge perhaps reporting individual lines or word as they are touched is doable. Touching individual characters seem overly verbosed and highly inefficient to me. I think this needs further research.* I've already written some thoughts on caret handling above when trying to explain the whole situation. This needs further research. I hope there's an API allowing us to fire caret moved events or something to that effect.* Repeating what has been read, spelling out, applying phonetic spelling such as alpha, bravo, charlie, delta.... this is the screen reader business and I hope you shouldn't need to tackle this.Excuse me for such a huge post. I've tried to write everything I know so you can take the best out of it.I am sure this will take a lot of time from both of us and perhaps some others if they will be able to join us in this.As I've said for the whole community this might become a life changer so while I'm excited I think even croud funding might be possible.thanks once again",pull_request
