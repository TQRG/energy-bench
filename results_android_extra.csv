Here's one hypothesis, which is total guesswork: there may be a race condition between the view switching to show a new conversation, and fetching the data to populate the view (interlocutor's name, conversation contents, etc.).  So when you switch to a new convo, you sometimes see the old value of $name_of_person_you're_talking_to before the new value can be displayed.  It may be that fetching the data is usually faster than switching the view, so the behavior isn't normally visible, but with reduced power the relative speeds of those two operations might change.
