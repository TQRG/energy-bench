Here's one hypothesis, which is total guesswork: there may be a race condition between the view switching to show a new conversation, and fetching the data to populate the view (interlocutor's name, conversation contents, etc.).  So when you switch to a new convo, you sometimes see the old value of $name_of_person_you're_talking_to before the new value can be displayed.  It may be that fetching the data is usually faster than switching the view, so the behavior isn't normally visible, but with reduced power the relative speeds of those two operations might change.

Sadly, this all comes down to the non-existing application permission options in stock Android. I am personally using a custom 4.4.2 ROM that still provides me with that capability, but that's obviously not for everyone. Still, I don't think granting a respected open-source application such as TextSecure this permission is particularly egregious. The problem with Android's app permission system is rather that nearly all applications, shady or not, ask for more permissions than necessary and might do things you don't agree with with that data. If anything, people should be more wary about installing software that isn't open-source or vetted in any way. It is surely not an ideal situation for normal, non-power users, and a more dynamic, iOS-like system might be preferable for them, but that's just not what we have now, I'm afraid.

You're probably interested in performance relative to the VP9 decoder that the platform provides, but the platform decoder varies by device and there's nothing like a (working) platform API for querying how performant a platform decoder is. Performance of both the platform decoder and the one in the extension may be affected differently by things like thermal CPU throttling, what else your app is doing and other processes that are consuming CPU, so relative performance may vary at runtime. Furthermore, what ""performance"" means really depends on what you want to optimize for. If you're playing 10 second clips there's probably no point optimizing for power consumption. If you're playing full length movies, it's far more important. So it's a really messy topic in practice.
