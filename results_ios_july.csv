Simplified the PVRenderDelegate. Wrapped the buffer swapping in PVEmulatorCore in an if statement to check whether it's double buffered since it should only be doing those swaps and locks in that case (cores that render to OpenGL will not be considered double-buffered). Fixed up the mupen video plugin loading code so that it works on my Apple TV and I assume other real devices. Mupen now renders into a 1024x512 texture (must be a power of two) using a 640x480 viewport. The render thread, through the use of its PVRenderDelegate implementation, takes care of setting up the render to texture and double-buffering it. Updated the drawInRect function to handle drawing from the render-to-texture result.",commit_message

Lyndir,MasterPassword,https://github.com/Lyndir/MasterPassword/issues/89,89,"The purpose of scrypt is to derive a long (64-byte) key from a tiny memorable password.  While brute-forcing a 64-byte key takes ages, brute-forcing a memorable password is trivial, especially at 12B/s.  We use scrypt over pbkdf2 because it is memory-hard.  The fact that scrypt is expensive is exactly the reason why I choose it: We need a 64-byte key derivation algorithm that takes a long time, but more importantly, one that takes JUST AS LONG for an attacker as it takes for a simple user.  This last part is what scrypt is really good at; an attacker can't buy a cheap ASIC system with a mass of cheap GPU power and get a better key derivation performance.  This property is what makes attempting to brute-force your master password so expensive (dollar-wise), because you need to buy a lot of RAM and CPU to be able to parallelize scrypt brute-forcing sufficiently.

thomasfinch,GammaThingy,https://github.com/thomasfinch/GammaThingy/issues/37,37,"Recently I saw some discussion here on this problem. Right now we use background refresh to check if the screen temperature must change, however this isn't very reliable, because it requires the screen to be enabled to change the colour. Now the [latest problems with battery of the Facebook app](https://www.macstories.net/linked/the-background-data-and-battery-usage-of-facebooks-ios-app/) set me thinking. What if we let the background fetch determine whether it's time to switch, and as soon it's time to switch we enable 'Audio background' playing. This allows the app to change the screen colour as soon as the device [is unlocked](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/706344/lock-unlock-events-iphone), because it can continuously run in the background.

But something like hotkey swapping could be implemented by the new 2:1 mapping feature as discussed above, where certain cores are configured to send a ""hotkey swap"" button in addition the core inputs, and then the hotkey swap functions (""e.g., A-button (C-button Up)"") are presented as additional core inputs for the user to select (on the right side).

I achieve a latency I am more than happy with using servers several hundred miles away. They are in fact faster than a home setup I use, since he is a specialist in this area and has a far better system than do I. Being a whitelist only provider belonging to a decentralised root NIC grants those who choose to use his servers a greater speed than any provider in the given list. Beyond that, I know with 100% certainty none of my activity is being logged to be used for and/or sold as data mining purposes. What I am saying is give me peace of mind over the ‚Äúhighest speeds possible‚Äù any day. I can wait some milliseconds longer; it‚Äôs just not that noticeable in real world usage scenarios. What fuels big data multinationals like Cloudfare is profit. And that absolutely does not come from what they charge for use of their servers. It comes from juicing end-users - you, me, and everyone else - of every last drop of our usage habits, packaging that up into chunks to sell to any number of other companies just like Facebook does, who then turn around and use what becomes full profiles of people for any means they see fit. Governments also benefit from this information to use against their own citizens (or anyone around he world, really), just as the German Democratic Republic - East Germany - benefited from the information gathered by both the Stasi and that gathered by neighbors of people. So you have a powerfully centralised organisation aided by its many, far reaching tentacles in both cases, all in the name of efficiency.

Additionally, the mention of bitcoin is only meant to surmise the computational cost vs humanly recognizable computational time. Simple fact of the matter is, is if you had access to that type of computational power you wouldn't be using it to crack passphrases...you'd be using it to make several trillions of dollars by mining bitcoin--so this argument is almost entirely a red herring.
