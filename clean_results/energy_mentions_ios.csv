thomasfinch,GammaThingy,https://github.com/thomasfinch/GammaThingy/issues/37,37,"Recently I saw some discussion here on this problem. Right now we use background refresh to check if the screen temperature must change, however this isn't very reliable, because it requires the screen to be enabled to change the colour. Now the [latest problems with battery of the Facebook app](https://www.macstories.net/linked/the-background-data-and-battery-usage-of-facebooks-ios-app/) set me thinking. What if we let the background fetch determine whether it's time to switch, and as soon it's time to switch we enable 'Audio background' playing. This allows the app to change the screen colour as soon as the device [is unlocked](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/706344/lock-unlock-events-iphone), because it can continuously run in the background.
