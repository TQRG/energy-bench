Simplified the PVRenderDelegate. Wrapped the buffer swapping in PVEmulatorCore in an if statement to check whether it's double buffered since it should only be doing those swaps and locks in that case (cores that render to OpenGL will not be considered double-buffered). Fixed up the mupen video plugin loading code so that it works on my Apple TV and I assume other real devices. Mupen now renders into a 1024x512 texture (must be a power of two) using a 640x480 viewport. The render thread, through the use of its PVRenderDelegate implementation, takes care of setting up the render to texture and double-buffering it. Updated the drawInRect function to handle drawing from the render-to-texture result.",commit_message

Lyndir,MasterPassword,https://github.com/Lyndir/MasterPassword/issues/89,89,"The purpose of scrypt is to derive a long (64-byte) key from a tiny memorable password.  While brute-forcing a 64-byte key takes ages, brute-forcing a memorable password is trivial, especially at 12B/s.  We use scrypt over pbkdf2 because it is memory-hard.  The fact that scrypt is expensive is exactly the reason why I choose it: We need a 64-byte key derivation algorithm that takes a long time, but more importantly, one that takes JUST AS LONG for an attacker as it takes for a simple user.  This last part is what scrypt is really good at; an attacker can't buy a cheap ASIC system with a mass of cheap GPU power and get a better key derivation performance.  This property is what makes attempting to brute-force your master password so expensive (dollar-wise), because you need to buy a lot of RAM and CPU to be able to parallelize scrypt brute-forcing sufficiently.

Now the [latest problems with battery of the Facebook app](https://www.macstories.net/linked/the-background-data-and-battery-usage-of-facebooks-ios-app/) set me thinking. What if we let the background fetch determine whether it's time to switch, and as soon it's time to switch we enable 'Audio background' playing. This allows the app to change the screen colour as soon as the device [is unlocked](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/706344/lock-unlock-events-iphone), because it can continuously run in the background.

I like to turn off my screen while driving and navigate using only the audible instructions (to save battery life.. plus it generally seems safer.. less of a distraction). This works wonderfully with Google Maps. With MAPS.ME (v5.2.1-Google), after I turn off the screen.. the phone will soon go into deep sleep. Presumably, the app uses a ""full"" wakelock that is released when the screen is turned off. What's weird is.. I used another app to manually set a ""partial"" wake lock that keeps the phone from going into deep sleep.. and yet MAPS.ME would still lose its GPS lock and failed to keep track of trip progress. The ""simple"" solution is to leave the screen on while driving. But I tend to be a fanatic about the optimization of battery life.. so having the ability to turn off the screen and allow the program to continue to voice turn-by-turn instructions would be a hugely appreciated feature.",Issue

I achieve a latency I am more than happy with using servers several hundred miles away. They are in fact faster than a home setup I use, since he is a specialist in this area and has a far better system than do I. Being a whitelist only provider belonging to a decentralised root NIC grants those who choose to use his servers a greater speed than any provider in the given list. Beyond that, I know with 100% certainty none of my activity is being logged to be used for and/or sold as data mining purposes. What I am saying is give me peace of mind over the “highest speeds possible” any day. I can wait some milliseconds longer; it’s just not that noticeable in real world usage scenarios. What fuels big data multinationals like Cloudfare is profit. And that absolutely does not come from what they charge for use of their servers. It comes from juicing end-users - you, me, and everyone else - of every last drop of our usage habits, packaging that up into chunks to sell to any number of other companies just like Facebook does, who then turn around and use what becomes full profiles of people for any means they see fit. Governments also benefit from this information to use against their own citizens (or anyone around he world, really), just as the German Democratic Republic - East Germany - benefited from the information gathered by both the Stasi and that gathered by neighbors of people.

hrydgard,ppsspp,https://github.com/hrydgard/ppsspp/pull/8750,8750,"In case any games apply gamma correction or etc. based on brightness, we should default to 84 (the standard max brightness on AC power) rather than 100.  Not sure if any games check, though.",PullRequest
hrydgard,ppsspp,https://github.com/hrydgard/ppsspp/pull/7772,7772,"It was a synthetic test to catch issues that may affect [Tier2](https://www.freebsd.org/doc/en/articles/committers-guide/archs.html#idp59530064) architectures like powerpc, sparc64. FreeBSD package builds are irregular for  them, so such (trivial) issues may not be noticed until months or years later.",PullRequest
hrydgard,ppsspp,https://github.com/hrydgard/ppsspp/pull/6699,6699,"NNEDI3 is a neural network image doubler. It does a really nice job on text and sprites. NNEDI3 tends to cause almost no aliasing or ringing, and doesn't smudge text as much as xBRZ. Since it can only scale to powers of two, spline36 is used to scale the image the rest of the way for any non-power of 2 factor. The biggest downside to NNEDI3 is that it is a rather slow algorithm. Even at its lowest settings I doubt most people will be able to run it at anything more than 3x in a game like Type-0 without a lot of hitching. Although, high-end AMD GPUs might be able to manage at higher settings. ",PullRequest
hrydgard,ppsspp,https://github.com/hrydgard/ppsspp/pull/6300,6300,Maybe I'll just validate more like the stride and stuff.. I'm just worried about mistreating textures that are in memory right after (or potentially even inside due to power of two) an oversized framebuffer.,PullRequest
hrydgard,ppsspp,https://github.com/hrydgard/ppsspp/pull/5696,5696,"It's really hard to get anything useful performance wise on Android it seems like.  Everything varies so much by run, and my FPS dances up and down and is never stable (I have power saving on so I can get < 100% speed and not deal with the impact of frameskip.)  But it seems like this is averaging faster per profile and fps.",PullRequest
