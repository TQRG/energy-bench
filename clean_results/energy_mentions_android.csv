A brief history of OpenCL in Dolphin. OpenCL was originally added to the Dolphin codebase 1 month after it was released with OS X Snow Leopard in 2009. OpenCL was one of the largest group projects that Dolphin ever has had. The OpenCL texture decoder was originally aded with version 1.0 of the OpenCL spec; This version didn't have the capability of a OpenCL-OpenGL interop which would allow for uploading textures once and have it decoded directly to a OpenGL texure. This was to be worked out when the OpenCL 1.1 spec was released and allowed the interop. This work has never been done, and no one in the team is willing to work on it for various reasons. OpenCL has had the unreasonable expectation that it increases the performance of video games that require a large amount of EFB copies like NSMBW. In reality, enabling OpenCL just put the graphics card in a higher power mode which increased the game speed. This is due to the unfortunate effect of Dolphin tending to not push GPUs out of their lower frequency power savings modes. Thanks to everyone that had contributed to the OpenCL texture decoder.",commit_message

It is hapenning when I play music through A2DP to a Mercedes' Online Connect Unit, and more specifically it only happens if I pause a song and play again. With Online Connect, when you pause or mute a song, it disconnects A2DP, keeping BT connected just for phone calls. When you unmute or play again, it starts the A2DP connection again (it takes less than 2 seconds to do so), and resumes music. If I do that, DSub starts draining battery at a very high rate.

So when you switch to a new convo, you sometimes see the old value of $name_of_person_you're_talking_to before the new value can be displayed.  It may be that fetching the data is usually faster than switching the view, so the behavior isn't normally visible, but with reduced power the relative speeds of those two operations might change.
