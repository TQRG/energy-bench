To me, personally, dynarecs on iOS is pretty much a lost cause unfortunately. I think dynarecs are really dependent on the processor used, and most of them are based around the 32-bit ARM processor. Since iOS is going 64-bit only, they won't work anyway in the future, until somebody updates those cores to work under 64-bit native ARM. Still, it's best to rely on interpreters (non-dynarecs) and rely on the power of the new processors each year to give the best emulation experience.",pull_request

We have  a retropad, and it has tons of buttons and certainly enough to handle the c-buttons on an n64 controller.  In my opinion, separate buttons for n64 should be the default, whereas any hotkey-swapping sort of things should be optional.  That is more of a power-user option anyway.  But something like hotkey swapping could be implemented by the new 2:1 mapping feature as discussed above, where certain cores are configured to send a ""hotkey swap"" button in addition the core inputs, and then the hotkey swap functions (""e.g., A-button (C-button Up)"") are presented as additional core inputs for the user to select (on the right side).
